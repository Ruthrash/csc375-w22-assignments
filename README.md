# Assignments for CSC375-w22

## Assignment 1

### Problem 1

* Open [this Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wkY9vhIgDNze50WehpmDWva355iMr5H_#scrollTo=qoVTIj44NZxM) and make a copy.
* Running the first 4 cells will take care of all dependencies you will require.
* Look for the spots that say "YOUR CODE STARTS HERE". There should be 3 functions you are required to fill in.

### Problem 2

* Open [this Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yGCLNq6KVLXDDK0iAdLCIpOM26ByYND9#scrollTo=fyGjJ64wTZGX) and make a copy.
* Look for the spots that say "Code starts here". There should be 6 functions you are required to fill in.

### Problem 3

* cd into csc375-w22-p3 in your cloned github directory.
* Run `pip install pybullet` in your command line shell.
* Look for "YOUR CODE STARTS HERE". There should be The only two files containing such statements are in `main.py` and `robot.py` and 6 places in total.
* You should not have to make any changes in any of the other files.
* After you are finished, running `python main.py` should bring up a simulated robot that picks up blocks, places them in the bins, then takes them out of the bin and repeats indefinitely.

## Assignment 2

### Problem 1

* Open P1_differential_flatness.py in HW2.
* Look for the spots that say "Code starts here". There should be 3 spots you are required to fill in.

### Problem 2

* Open [this Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wx2PCfylkaBOlEu2zWwRROZiAThHfKjG#scrollTo=x5GXJ5k_Pj9A) and make a copy.
* Look for the spots that say "YOUR CODE STARTS HERE". There should be 9 spots you are required to fill in.

### Problem 3

* From your command line: cd kuka_grasp_rl.
* Look for the spots that say "Code starts here". There should be 5 spots you are required to fill in in agents.py and kuka_grasp_actor_critic.py.
* Run by calling: python kuka_grasp_actor_critic.py.
* renders=True in the env initialization will enable the GUI when running on your local machine. This will help with debugging.
* After you have debugged, use UTM machines for training in full, by disabling the GUI (renders=False in the env initialization). This will train faster.
